So, since I don't have Steam installed, I'm gonna talk about random stuff here, and hopefully you'll actually read it.
So I'm at this computer science camp right now, and they gave us these three problems from this competition. They're actually pretty hard.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!! D: Yeah, so this camp goes from 8:30 to 6, and right now, we're all just sitting here typing on our computers. Of course, everyone else is programming, and I'm not. :D
Anyway, I have to figure this out. BAI :D
